Today was fairly straightforward, but I swear to god this loop inside a loop thing is going to kill me. Its so dirty and unclean and there are curly brackets in too many places. It's just an accident waiting to happen, and then that accident happens for infinity. I feel pretty good about the concepts of both of them individually (though i'll likely have to look back at syntax for a bit).

Arrays are also straightforward on a basic level, but i get the feeling that it's a much more powerful tool that i've only scratched the surface of. At this point, it feels just like an ordered list of data, without much functional power. I know that's untrue. It's sort of like someone showing you that a power drill can drive a screw. Interesting, useful, but until you understand that it can drill holes, take out screws, auger things, be a rotary sander, be a buffer, be a scrub brush for cleaning, and act as an emergency lathe, you don't really have a respect for the tool.
