I actually feel pretty great about JS logic and how everything flows together. Yeah, nesting for loops and functions and everything is a pain, but i actually think i can follow that logic.

DOM manipulation however throws a big fat wrench in that plan. It really makes it difficult for me (for some reason) to track how elements from my javascript show up in teh DOM, i think that's just practice when it gets down to it.
