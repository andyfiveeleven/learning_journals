Ohhhhhh dom manipulation, I learned that i can do you today. I learned a bit about the connection between the two, but to be honest the syntax is a little fuzzy so far, i feel like i'll need to learn a bit about the functions we used today to publish that information. create elements and append childs and stuff just aren't that familiar to me. I got the assignment, but mostly from taking the code we wrote today and applying it. I'm doing more practice on my own, but this is the first time i've really entered uncharted territory (everything previously was something i'm used to, if even a little bit!)
