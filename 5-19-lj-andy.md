Today was good, i fell like i have a great grasp on CSS, i can truck through it, i'm not a great designer, but i'm pretty darn good at creating a layout from mockup. I learned a bit about font finding though! I like this kind of work a lot!

I feel like the past two days have been great for catchup! I got a good grasp on the JS and DOM realtionship.
