Day one
Ahhhhhhhh CSS, I feel like I have an understanding of how css and html interact, but an understanding is much different than a practical knowledge. I'm certain that part of that is just practice, but I do get a big of a feeling that I'll have a fair number of head bash moments.

Hopefully box model will clear this up, and the ability to use and manage percentages for width. Classes will help too, but managing all of that might be a bit difficult. I'm trying to use them in my basic about_me right now, to varying levels of success.
