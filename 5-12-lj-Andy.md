Today was great. I feel like i have a handle on both javascript and CSS. Getting the css challenge today made me feel so good. I think my javascript logic could use soem help. I definitely have a good handle on the read and create, but the write is a bit behind. All the logic takes a long time for me to run through (and sometimes it takes an Eddie to prime the pump) that being said, i think i'm doing fairly well, even when i get help on the logic i can consistantly explain the why and how. 

Overall i feel good. i learned a lot today about css layout and capping functions, which was amazing. Hoping to expand next week!
