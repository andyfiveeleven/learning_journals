Today was weird, i didn't use much of the programming we used in class for the assignment, so i felt like i didn't absorb much from this morning. Definitely a "i'm going to look that up" in the future kind of thing.

I did enjoy the assignment though, i feel like i learned a lot about dom manipulation!
