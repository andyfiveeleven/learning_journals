#5-24 Local Storage.

Today was a rare day, I was more confused during class than I was during lab. The implementation of local storage is actually very straightforward, there will be a little bit of hiccuping in the future I anticipate (yes it turns it into strings but how do those strings actually show up?)

I want to take a bit of time to find implementations of that for my application presentation today.
